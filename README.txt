Do not use this yet unless you are dying to help out. 
I'm going to gem this up and such when I finish the full api.

Also, I'm going to separate Google::Connection into it's own 
gem and add that as a dependency for the reader gem. This will 
allow easy reuse of the google authentication.

I'm using the following links below as documentation 
(and also a bit of reverse engineering with Firebug):
